
JEditable contains something which isn't quite a bug but isn't quite right either; this breaks edit-in-place if you click between different EiP-enabled controls. If you update the version of JEditable on this site, please apply the patch below to the new code before deploying.

==============================================================================================

1. Add the following withing the root (function($){}) block (near line 60, after comments):

var currentEditor = null;



2. Add the following code within the bound settings.event callback function (near line 127), as the first peice of code:

if(currentEditor != null && currentEditor != this)
{
	currentEditor = null;
	return;
}
currentEditor = this;


3. Add the following at the start of the form.submit() function (near line 306)

currentEditor = null;


Don't forget to minify!

Thankyou!
